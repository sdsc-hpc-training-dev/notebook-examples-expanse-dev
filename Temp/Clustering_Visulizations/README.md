# Clustering Visualization

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.


This chapter will teach you how to use scipy as well as sklearn packages to perform data clustering visualization as well as analyzing clustering. Enjoy!
