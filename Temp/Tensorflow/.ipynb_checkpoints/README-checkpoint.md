TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.

This chapter will show you how to implement an image classifaction NN as well as how to train an NN. Enjoy!
